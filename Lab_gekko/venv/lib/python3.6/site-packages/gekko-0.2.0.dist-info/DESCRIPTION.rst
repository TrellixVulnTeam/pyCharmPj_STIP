GEKKO
=====

GEKKO is a python package for machine learning and optimization, specializing in
dynamic optimization of differential algebraic equations (DAE) systems. GEKKO 
provides a user-friendly interface to the powerful APMonitor optimization suite
on the back end. It is coupled with large-scale solvers for linear, quadratic,
nonlinear, and mixed integer programming (LP, QP, NLP, MILP, MINLP). Capabilities
include machine learning, discrete or continuous models, real-time optimization, 
simulation, moving horizon estimation, and nonlinear predictive control.
